## Introduction

This package contains common components and methods for several packages wrapping Stan's `cmdstan` executable. 

Actual Stan `methods` supported, e.g. `stan_sample()`,  `stan_optimize()`, etc., are in StanSample, StanOptimize, StanVariational, StanDiagnose and `generated_quantities` (included in StanSample.jl). 

A new package, DiffEqBayesStan.jl is available to focus on DifferentialEquations and Stan.

Another package, StanQuap.jl, provides a quadratic approximation using StanOptimize.jl and StanSample.jl which I have used in the early chapters of [StatisticalRethinking](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia).

These six application packages support all features and options currently available in the `cmdstan` executable.

## Installation

This package is registered. Install it with:
```Julia
pkg> add StanBase
```
although the intention is that users of Stan's `cmdstan` executable will never have to install StanBase.jl, they can simply install any of the application packages listed [here](https://github.com/StanJulia). 

This and all the method packages need a working [cmdstan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/cmdstan.html) installation, the path of which you should specify in `CMDSTAN`, e.g. in your `~/.julia/config/startup.jl` have a line like:
```julia
ENV["CMDSTAN"] = expanduser("~/.../cmdstan/") # replace with your path
```

This package is structured somewhat similar to Tamas Papp's [StanRun.jl](https://github.com/tpapp/StanRun.jl) package. 

## Versions

StanBase.jl v4 supports Stan.jl v9 and StanSample v6 which by default use C++ level threads (and chains). This has major consequences for StanSample.jl and Stan.jl (explained in the documentation of Stan.jl v9 and in the on-line help in StanSample.jl v6). As such StanBase.jl v4 is a breaking update.

StanBase.jl versions < v4.0.0 used StanDump.jl to create data.R and init.R files. It is no longer clear if .R files will be supported in future version of cmdstan. Certainly with cmdstan-2.28.2 I have seen error messages when using init.R files. Hence version 4 uses by default JSON3.jl for this purpose. As JSON3.jl currently doesn't handle multidimensional arrays properly, for now I have added a positional `use_json=true` argument to e.g. stan_sample().
